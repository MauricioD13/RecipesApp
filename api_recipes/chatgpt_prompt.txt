Perform a *deep search* across technical blogs, white-papers, job boards, freelancing platforms, and 2024-2025 market reports.
I also want to create a system to enable me to organize this proposals and connect my team. I want to know which tools could I use
like Jira to manage projects, prometheus to monitor the deployment app, etc

Tasks:  
1. Map market demand trends & typical budgets for each skill area.  
2. Surface 10 concrete productised-service ideas (e.g., “Iterative AWS Well-Architected Review + Terraform remediation package”).  
3. For every idea provide:  
   • 2–3 authoritative references (URL + title)  
   • Short justification (≤ 75 words)  
   • Evidence of demand (stats, job-post counts, report excerpt)  
4. Summarise optimal pricing models (fixed, retainer, value-based).
